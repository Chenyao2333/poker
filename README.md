# Poker

Rule-based collect files and backup tool!

## Quick Start

### Case: Backup all the source code in cpp\python\go, and the .git directorys which size is less than 10m. Then save them to `/opt/backup/`.

Just write the following into `task.yml`, and run `poker -f task.yml`!

~~~yml
save_to:
  disk: /opt/poker

tasks:
  home:
    directory: "/home/louch"
    matchs:
      - suffix:
        - py
        - cpp
        - go
      - and:
        - name: .git
        - dir_size: < 10m

    ignores:
        - name:
          - "go1.9"
          - "anaconda3"
~~~
